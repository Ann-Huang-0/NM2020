Scientific Question: How does population coding in different brain regions predict the neural mechanism of perception in two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task?

Scientific Background: Many brain regions are known to be involved in sensory processing and decision making in rodents, but their specific roles have remained unclear. For instance, can neural coding in different brain regions underlie how incorrect choices are made?

Analysis: PCA for dimensionality reduction; GLM / logistic regression for classification; clustering; Hidden Markov Model for temporal analysis

Predictions: Errors in small-contrast-difference trials are better predicted by neural responses in sensory processing regions whereas errors in large-contrast-difference trials are better predicted by neural responses in decision-making regions
